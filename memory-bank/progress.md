#### Critical Bug Fixes Completed
1. **TypeScript Build Configuration**
   - Issue: Functions couldn't find shared game engine modules
   - Solution: Created `api/lib-shared/` directory with copied modules
   - Fixed: All imports updated from `../../dist/shared/` to `../lib-shared/`
   - Updated: tsconfig.json with correct rootDir and paths

2. **Azure Functions v4 Package Configuration**
   - Issue: Functions not discovered at runtime
   - Solution: Set package.json `main` to `"dist/**/*.js"` (glob pattern)
   - Removed: Invalid `src/functions.ts` file that wasn't needed

3. **Storage Table Initialization**
   - Issue: "Entity not found" errors on fresh Azurite instances
   - Solution: Added `ensureTable()` calls in all create methods
   - Impact: Tables auto-create on first use, preventing initialization errors

#### Testing Results
- ✅ **createGame endpoint** - Successfully tested with curl
- ✅ **All 9 Functions** - Loaded and registered on port 7076
- ✅ **Azurite connection** - Table Storage integration working
- ✅ **First game created** - gameId: game_c790fff30cd58185
- ✅ **Manual test suite** - 22 scenarios documented and ready
- ✅ **API Integration Tests** - 3/3 tests passing with automated framework
- ✅ **Complete test coverage** - 224 total tests (207 unit + 14 game integration + 3 API integration)

#### Automated Test Infrastructure
- ✅ **Test Organization** - Reorganized into unit/, integration/, manual/, helpers/ structure
- ✅ **API Test Helpers** - Reusable utilities for creating games, starting rounds, submitting solutions
- ✅ **Integration Test Framework** - End-to-end testing with Azurite and Azure Functions
- ✅ **CI/CD Documentation** - Requirements and setup guide created
- ✅ **Test Coverage** - All 224 tests passing (3 API tests skipped by default)

#### Success Criteria
- ✅ All endpoints implemented and functional
- ✅ Storage layer handles all data operations with auto-table-creation
- ✅ Solution validation uses game engine correctly
- ✅ Host authentication working (inline validation + storage check)
- ✅ Timer function processes round expiration (5-minute intervals)
- ✅ Multi-color goals supported throughout
- ✅ Board persistence across rounds implemented
- ✅ Goal skip returns goals to pool correctly
- ✅ Game ends after 17 completions
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation created
- ✅ **Manual testing infrastructure ready**
- ✅ **First successful API call confirmed**
- ✅ **Automated API integration tests working**
- ✅ **Complete test coverage achieved**

#### Key Learnings from Phase 3
1. **TypeScript Build Complexity** - Azure Functions v4 requires careful path configuration
2. **Import Path Management** - Shared code between tests and API needs duplication for isolation
3. **Storage Auto-Init** - Always call ensureTable() in create operations for robustness
4. **Microsoft Docs Accuracy** - Package.json main field accepts glob patterns (not obvious)
5. **Azurite Testing Value** - Local storage emulator catches issues before deployment
6. **Manual Test Documentation** - Comprehensive test scenarios help with future debugging

### ⏳ Phase 5: Polish & Testing (PLANNED)
**Status:** Not Started  
**Target Duration:** 4-6 hours  
**Completion:** 0%

#### Planned Tasks
- [ ] End-to-end testing
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] UX polish (animations, transitions)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Mobile testing
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Create README with setup instructions
- [ ] Create deployment guide

### ✅ Phase 6: Deployment (COMPLETE)
**Status:** Complete  
**Completion:** 100%  
**Completed:** October 10, 2025

#### Completed Tasks
- [x] Azure Static Web App created
- [x] Azure Functions v4 configured
- [x] GitHub Actions CI/CD configured
- [x] Deployment workflow operational
- [x] **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed forbidden `AzureWebJobsStorage` app setting
- [x] Production deployment successful
- [x] API functions operational in production
- [x] Monitoring configured

#### Deployment Success

**Production URL:** https://icy-glacier-0f757cb0f.1.azurestaticapps.net/

**Critical Issue Resolved:**
- **Problem**: Deployment failing with "Failed to deploy the Azure Functions"
- **Root Cause**: Forbidden app setting `AzureWebJobsStorage` in Static Web App configuration
- **Solution**: Removed `AzureWebJobsStorage` from Azure Portal application settings
- **Result**: ✅ Successful deployment, all API functions operational

**Key Learning:** Azure Static Web Apps uses **Managed Functions** which automatically handle storage configuration. Manually setting `AzureWebJobsStorage` conflicts with the managed system and causes deployment rejection.

**Documentation Updated:**
- ✅ `doc/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Added deployment fix details and warning
- ✅ `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Documented troubleshooting process

## Learning & Insights

### What's Working Well
- Comprehensive design phase prevents confusion later
- Clear documentation serves as implementation guide
- Memory Bank pattern helps with context preservation
- User involvement in design ensures requirements are clear
- **Iterative refinement caught design issues before implementation**

### What to Improve
- Could have prototyped core algorithm earlier
- Consider performance earlier in design
- Plan for testing infrastructure upfront
- **Research authentic game mechanics earlier** (saved significant rework)

### Key Learnings
1. Serverless architecture is simpler than expected
2. Polling is viable alternative to WebSockets
3. Vanilla JS keeps complexity low
4. Multi-game system adds flexibility
5. Documentation upfront saves time later
6. **User feedback on design details is invaluable** (L-shapes, goals, etc.)
7. **Authentic game mechanics > arbitrary design** (sparse walls are better)
8. **Board persistence creates emergent difficulty** (clever design choice)
