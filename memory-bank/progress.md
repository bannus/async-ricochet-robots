## Learning & Insights

### What's Working Well
- Comprehensive design phase prevents confusion later
- Clear documentation serves as implementation guide
- Memory Bank pattern helps with context preservation
- User involvement in design ensures requirements are clear
- **Iterative refinement caught design issues before implementation**

### What to Improve
- Could have prototyped core algorithm earlier
- Consider performance earlier in design
- Plan for testing infrastructure upfront
- **Research authentic game mechanics earlier** (saved significant rework)

### Key Learnings
1. Serverless architecture is simpler than expected
2. Polling is viable alternative to WebSockets
3. Vanilla JS keeps complexity low
4. Multi-game system adds flexibility
5. Documentation upfront saves time later
6. **User feedback on design details is invaluable** (L-shapes, goals, etc.)
7. **Authentic game mechanics > arbitrary design** (sparse walls are better)
8. **Board persistence creates emergent difficulty** (clever design choice)
