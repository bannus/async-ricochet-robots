- [x] API design and specification
- [x] Data model design (Azure Table Storage)
- [x] Game rules documentation
- [x] User flow mapping
- [x] Memory Bank setup
- [x] **Design refinements based on authentic Ricochet Robots mechanics**

#### Deliverables

#### Key Decisions
1. Azure serverless architecture (Static Web Apps + Functions + Table Storage)
2. HTTP polling instead of WebSockets (20-second interval)
3. Multi-game system with host-controlled rounds
4. Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks) for simplicity
5. One solution per player per round (no resubmission)
6. **L-shaped walls only (17 pieces, one per goal)**
7. **Board persistence with robot position accumulation**
8. **Multi-color goal support (any robot can win)**
9. **Goal skip functionality (returns to pool)**
10. **17-goal game lifecycle (ends when all complete)**

6. Implement to pass test
7. Continue TDD cycle

### This Week
- Complete Phase 2 (Core Game Engine)
- Begin Phase 3 (Backend API)

### This Month
- Complete MVP (Phases 2-4)
- Begin testing and polish

## Learning & Insights

### What's Working Well
- Comprehensive design phase prevents confusion later
- Clear documentation serves as implementation guide
- Memory Bank pattern helps with context preservation
- User involvement in design ensures requirements are clear
- **Iterative refinement caught design issues before implementation**

### What to Improve
- Could have prototyped core algorithm earlier
- Consider performance earlier in design
- Plan for testing infrastructure upfront
- **Research authentic game mechanics earlier** (saved significant rework)

### Key Learnings
1. Serverless architecture is simpler than expected
2. Polling is viable alternative to WebSockets
3. Vanilla JS keeps complexity low
4. Multi-game system adds flexibility
5. Documentation upfront saves time later
6. **User feedback on design details is invaluable** (L-shapes, goals, etc.)
7. **Authentic game mechanics > arbitrary design** (sparse walls are better)
8. **Board persistence creates emergent difficulty** (clever design choice)
