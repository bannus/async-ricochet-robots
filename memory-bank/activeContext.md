# Active Context: Async Ricochet Robots

## Current Status

**Phase:** Phase 4+ - Feature Enhancements (IN PROGRESS)  
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Completion:** ~90%  
**Next Milestone:** Final testing and polish

## Active Work (Last Session - October 16, 2025)

### Solution Replay UX Improvements ✅ (COMPLETED)
- **Feature**: Two UX improvements to replay feature after user testing
- **Status**: Both issues fixed and working
- **Time**: ~30 minutes
- **Files**: 
  - MODIFIED: `client/src/player-app.ts`
  - DOCS: `doc/implementation/solution-replay.md`
- **Issues Fixed**:
  1. **Exit Replay Not Resetting**: Robots now return to starting positions when exiting replay
  2. **Cannot Switch Replays**: Users can now click different leaderboard entries during replay without manual exit

### Solution Replay Feature ✅ (COMPLETED October 14, 2025)
- **Feature**: Animated solution replay after round ends
- **Status**: Fully implemented and working, with UX improvements added
- **Time**: ~3 hours initial + 30 min improvements
- **Files**: 
  - NEW: `client/src/replay-controller.ts`
  - MODIFIED: `client/src/player-app.ts`, `client/index.html`, `client/css/game.css`
  - DOCS: `doc/implementation/solution-replay.md`, `doc/api-specification.md`
- **Key Features**:
  - Click leaderboard entries to watch animated replays
  - 500ms pauses between moves
  - Exit with button or ESC key (resets to starting positions)
  - Seamlessly switch between different replays with single clicks
  - Clean UI with DOM-based replay banner
  - Player controls hidden when round ends
- **Bugs Fixed During Implementation**:
  1. Click handlers checking wrong field name
  2. API field mismatch (`solutionData` → `moves`)
  3. ReplayController interface field mismatch
  4. Removed redundant canvas overlays
  5. Exit replay not resetting robot positions
  6. Cannot switch between replays without manual exit

### Previous: Mobile Robot Movement ✅ (October 13, 2025)
- **Issue**: Game unusable on mobile - no touch controls + desktop clicks broken
- **Fix Applied**: Integrated Hammer.js for swipe gestures + fixed click coordinate bug
- **Status**: Complete and verified
- **Files**: `client/src/game-controller.ts`, `client/assets/hammer.min.js`, `client/css/game.css`

### Debugging Setup Complete ✅ (October 12, 2025)
- Full-stack F5 debugging operational with SWA CLI
- Both client and API breakpoints working
- Documentation complete in `doc/DEBUGGING.md`

### Host Panel Complete ✅ (October 11-12, 2025)
- Host controls integrated into main UI
- Dashboard, round management, share links all functional
- CSS polish applied with keyboard accessibility (WCAG 2.1)

## Next Steps (Immediate)

### 1. Testing & Validation (Next Session)

- [ ] Verify UI controls hide/show correctly when round ends/starts
- [ ] Mobile responsive verification for replay controls
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility check
- [ ] Performance validation

### 2. Final Phase 4+ Completion (~1-2 hours remaining)
- [ ] Address any bugs discovered in testing
- [ ] Final CSS polish if needed
- [ ] Update user documentation

### 3. Move to Phase 5 (Polish & Production)
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] UX enhancements (loading states, better feedback)
- [ ] Accessibility review (WCAG 2.1 compliance)
- [ ] User guide creation
- [ ] Production deployment checklist

## Current Blockers
