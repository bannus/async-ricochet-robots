  - 500ms pauses between moves
  - Exit with button or ESC key
  - Clean UI with DOM-based replay banner
  - Player controls hidden when round ends
- **Bugs Fixed During Implementation**:
  1. Click handlers checking wrong field name

  3. ReplayController interface field mismatch
  4. Removed redundant canvas overlays

### Previous: Mobile Robot Movement ✅ (October 13, 2025)
- **Issue**: Game unusable on mobile - no touch controls + desktop clicks broken
- **Fix Applied**: Integrated Hammer.js for swipe gestures + fixed click coordinate bug
- **Status**: Complete and verified
- **Files**: `client/src/game-controller.ts`, `client/assets/hammer.min.js`, `client/css/game.css`

### Debugging Setup Complete ✅ (October 12, 2025)
- Full-stack F5 debugging operational with SWA CLI
- Both client and API breakpoints working
- Documentation complete in `doc/DEBUGGING.md`

### Host Panel Complete ✅ (October 11-12, 2025)
- Host controls integrated into main UI
- Dashboard, round management, share links all functional
- CSS polish applied with keyboard accessibility (WCAG 2.1)

## Next Steps (Immediate)

### 1. Testing & Validation (Next Session)

- [ ] Performance validation

### 2. Final Phase 4+ Completion (~1-2 hours remaining)
- [ ] Address any bugs discovered in testing
- [ ] Final CSS polish if needed
- [ ] Update user documentation

### 3. Move to Phase 5 (Polish & Production)
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] UX enhancements (loading states, better feedback)
- [ ] Accessibility review (WCAG 2.1 compliance)
- [ ] User guide creation
- [ ] Production deployment checklist

## Current Blockers

**None** - Project progressing smoothly

## Open Issues

### Active Bugs (doc/BUGS.md)
- Bug #5: Round timer doesn't update dynamically

## Notes for Next Session

1. **Replay feature testing** - Verify end-to-end replay functionality
2. **UI state management** - Confirm controls hide/show correctly when round ends/starts
3. **Mobile replay testing** - Test replay controls on mobile devices
4. **E2E gameplay flow** - Complete round → submit → replay → new round
5. **Production readiness** - Final checks before Phase 5

## Context for AI Assistant

When resuming work:
- Project is ~90% complete, Phase 4+ enhancements done
- **Solution replay feature COMPLETE** - Fully working, documented
- All major features implemented (player UI, host panel, API, game engine, replay)
- Focus should be on final testing and moving toward Phase 5 (polish & production)
- Memory bank restructured with systemPatterns.md and techContext.md
- Key files: `client/src/replay-controller.ts`, `doc/implementation/solution-replay.md`
