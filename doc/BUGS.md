## ðŸŸ¡ High Priority Issues

### Bug #10: NPM Package Vulnerabilities
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Location:** `package.json` (client dependencies)  
**Discovered:** npm audit

**Description:**  
NPM audit reports 6 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 4 high) in the dependency tree.

**Vulnerability Details:**
```
braces <3.0.3
Severity: high
Uncontrolled resource consumption in braces
https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-grv7-fg5c-xmjg

Dependency chain:
- braces (vulnerable)
  â””â”€ chokidar 1.3.0 - 2.1.8
     â””â”€ live-server >=1.2.1
  â””â”€ micromatch <=4.0.7
     â””â”€ anymatch 1.2.0 - 2.0.0
        â””â”€ readdirp 2.2.0 - 2.2.1
```

**Expected Behavior:**  
- No security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Up-to-date packages with security patches

**Actual Behavior:**  
- 6 vulnerabilities present (2 moderate, 4 high)
- Outdated versions of braces, chokidar, micromatch, anymatch, readdirp

**Root Cause:**  
Outdated `live-server` dev dependency using vulnerable versions of its dependencies.

**Fix Plan:**
1. Run `npm audit fix --force` to update to live-server@1.2.0
   - Note: This is a breaking change, requires testing
2. Alternative: Replace live-server with a different dev server (e.g., http-server, serve)
3. Test that dev server still works after update
4. Verify no functionality broken by the update
5. Re-run `npm audit` to confirm vulnerabilities resolved

**Important Notes:**
- These are **dev dependencies only** (live-server)
- Does NOT affect production build or deployed code
- Security risk is limited to development environment
- Still worth fixing for developer security and clean audits

**Affected Components:**
- `client/package.json` (live-server dependency)
- Development workflow (local server)

## ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority Issues

### Bug #5: Extend Button Misleading Label
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¢ Low  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Location:** `client/index.html`, `client/src/host-manager.ts`  
**Discovered:** E2E Testing Phase 4

**Description:**  
The "Extend Deadline" button displays "(+6h)" suggesting it will extend by exactly 6 hours, but it actually prompts the user for a custom number of hours.

**Expected Behavior (Two Options):**
- **Option A:** Button extends by exactly 6 hours (no prompt)
- **Option B:** Button label should be "Extend Deadline..." (indicating prompt)

**Actual Behavior:**  
- Button says "Extend Deadline (+6h)"
- Clicking shows prompt for custom hours
- User can enter any value

**Root Cause:**  
Label doesn't match functionality

**Fix Plan:**  
Choose one approach:
- **Option A:** Remove prompt, extend by 6h exactly, add another button for custom
- **Option B:** Change label to "Extend Deadline..." or "Extend Deadline (Custom)"

**Recommendation:** Option B - More flexible for different game pacing needs

**Affected Components:**
- `client/index.html` (button text)
- `client/src/host-manager.ts` (extendRound method)

### Bug #8: Flash Before Splash Screen
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¢ Low  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Location:** `client/index.html` or page initialization  
**Discovered:** User Testing

**Description:**  
On initial page load, there is a brief flash (~1 second) where the underlying game page is visible before the "Start New Game" splash screen loads and covers it.

**Expected Behavior:**  
- Splash screen should be immediately visible on page load
- No underlying content should be visible before splash screen appears
- Smooth, professional loading experience

**Actual Behavior:**  
- Brief flash of game board/UI visible
- Splash screen loads after ~1 second delay
- Creates unprofessional first impression

**Root Cause:** TBD  
**Likely Issues:**
- Splash screen element not in initial HTML
- Splash screen created via JavaScript after page load
- CSS not properly hiding game UI on initial load
- Race condition between page render and splash display

**Fix Plan:**
1. Option A: Add splash screen to initial HTML with CSS to show by default
2. Option B: Add CSS to hide game UI until splash is dismissed
3. Option C: Use CSS loading animation/skeleton screen
4. Test various network speeds to ensure consistent behavior

**Affected Components:**
- `client/index.html` (splash screen HTML)
- `client/css/shared.css` or `client/css/game.css` (initial load styles)
- `client/src/player-app.ts` or `client/src/game-controller.ts` (initialization)

### Bug #11: Punycode Deprecation Warning
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¢ Low  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Location:** Node.js runtime dependencies  
**Discovered:** Runtime console output

**Description:**  
Node.js deprecation warning appears during runtime:
```
(node:37164) [DEP0040] DeprecationWarning: The `punycode` module is deprecated. 
Please use a userland alternative instead.
```

**Expected Behavior:**  
- No deprecation warnings in console
- Dependencies use modern, non-deprecated APIs

**Actual Behavior:**  
- Warning appears during runtime
- Creates console noise
- No functional impact

**Root Cause:**  
One or more dependencies are using the deprecated built-in `punycode` module instead of the userland `punycode` package.

**Fix Plan:**
1. Identify which dependency is using deprecated punycode module
   - Run with `--trace-warnings` flag to find source
2. Check if newer version of that dependency is available
3. Update dependency to version that uses userland punycode
4. If no update available, consider alternative package
5. Verify warning no longer appears

**Affected Components:**
- `package.json` or `api/package.json` (whichever has the problematic dependency)
- Various npm dependencies (TBD which specific package)

### Bug #12: util._extend Deprecation Warning
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¢ Low  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Location:** Node.js runtime dependencies  
**Discovered:** Runtime console output

**Description:**  
Node.js deprecation warning appears during runtime:
```
(node:37164) [DEP0060] DeprecationWarning: The `util._extend` API is deprecated. 
Please use Object.assign() instead.
```

**Expected Behavior:**  
- No deprecation warnings in console
- Dependencies use modern APIs (Object.assign)

**Actual Behavior:**  
- Warning appears during runtime
- Creates console noise
- No functional impact

**Root Cause:**  
One or more dependencies are using the deprecated `util._extend` API instead of the standard `Object.assign()`.

**Fix Plan:**
1. Identify which dependency is using deprecated util._extend
   - Run with `--trace-warnings` flag to find source
2. Check if newer version of that dependency is available
3. Update dependency to version that uses Object.assign
4. If no update available, consider alternative package
5. Verify warning no longer appears

**Affected Components:**
- `package.json` or `api/package.json` (whichever has the problematic dependency)
- Various npm dependencies (TBD which specific package)
