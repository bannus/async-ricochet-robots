## 🟡 High Priority Issues

### Bug #3: Host Controls Shows "undefined/17"
**Priority:** 🟡 High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Location:** `client/src/host-manager.ts`  
**Discovered:** E2E Testing Phase 4

**Description:**  
The host controls statistics card for "Goals" displays "undefined/17" instead of the actual number of completed goals.

**Expected Behavior:**  
- Should show "0/17" at game start
- Should increment as goals are completed (e.g., "5/17")

**Actual Behavior:**  
- Shows "undefined/17"

**Root Cause:** TBD  
**Likely Issues:**
- `data.goalsCompleted` not set in dashboard API response
- Property name mismatch between API and client
- Data not being passed to `displayStats()` correctly

**Fix Plan:**
1. Check `/host/dashboard` API response structure
2. Verify `goalsCompleted` is being returned
3. Check `host-manager.ts` `displayStats()` data mapping
4. Add null/undefined check and default to 0

**Affected Components:**
- `api/host/dashboard/index.ts`
- `client/src/host-manager.ts` (displayStats method)

### Bug #6: Quadrant Definition Overly Restrictive
**Priority:** 🟡 High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Location:** `shared/goal-placement.ts` (QUADRANTS definition)  
**Discovered:** Code Review

**Description:**  
The QUADRANTS definition excludes all of rows and columns 7-8 to avoid the center square, but this is overly restrictive. The center square only occupies 4 specific cells: (7,7), (7,8), (8,7), (8,8). The current implementation excludes 28 valid positions unnecessarily.

**Current Behavior:**
```typescript
// Quadrants are 6×6 (36 cells each)
{ name: 'NW', xMin: 1, xMax: 6, yMin: 1, yMax: 6 },
{ name: 'NE', xMin: 9, xMax: 14, yMin: 1, yMax: 6 },
{ name: 'SW', xMin: 1, xMax: 6, yMin: 9, yMax: 14 },
{ name: 'SE', xMin: 9, xMax: 14, yMin: 9, yMax: 14 }
```

**Expected Behavior:**
```typescript
// Quadrants should be 7×7 (49 cells each) with center check
{ name: 'NW', xMin: 1, xMax: 7, yMin: 1, yMax: 7 },
{ name: 'NE', xMin: 8, xMax: 14, yMin: 1, yMax: 7 },
{ name: 'SW', xMin: 1, xMax: 7, yMin: 8, yMax: 14 },
{ name: 'SE', xMin: 8, xMax: 14, yMin: 8, yMax: 14 }
// Plus center exclusion check in randomPositionInQuadrant()
```

**Impact:**
- Reduces available goal placement space by 13 cells per quadrant (28%)
- May contribute to goal generation failures requiring retries
- Makes puzzle generation less efficient

**Root Cause:**  
Overly conservative approach to avoiding center square - excluding entire rows/columns instead of just the 4 center cells.

**Fix Plan:**
1. Update QUADRANTS to use full 7×7 ranges (1-7 and 8-14)
2. Add center exclusion check to `randomPositionInQuadrant()`:
   ```typescript
   // Exclude center 2×2 square
   if ((x === 7 || x === 8) && (y === 7 || y === 8)) {
     continue; // retry
   }
   ```
3. Update tests to verify goals never appear in center square
4. Test that generation succeeds with fewer retries

**Affected Components:**
- `shared/goal-placement.ts` (QUADRANTS and randomPositionInQuadrant)
- `tests/unit/goal-placement.test.ts` (validation tests)

## 🟡 High Priority Issues (continued)

### Bug #9: No Mobile Robot Movement
**Priority:** 🟡 High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Location:** Mobile UI - needs touch controls  
**Discovered:** User Testing

**Description:**  
There is no way to move robots on mobile devices without a keyboard. The game is currently keyboard-only, making it completely unusable on mobile devices.

**Expected Behavior:**  
- Touch-based controls for robot movement
- Options could include: directional buttons, swipe gestures, or on-screen directional pad
- Touch controls should be as intuitive as keyboard controls

**Actual Behavior:**  
- Only keyboard arrow keys work for robot movement
- No touch/tap controls available
- Mobile users cannot play the game

**Root Cause:** TBD  
**Likely Issues:**
- No mobile UI implementation
- No touch event handlers
- Game controller only listens for keyboard events

**Fix Plan:**
1. Design mobile control scheme (directional buttons recommended)
2. Add touch event handlers to game controller
3. Create mobile-responsive UI for control buttons
4. Test on various mobile devices and screen sizes
5. Consider adding swipe gesture support as enhancement

**Affected Components:**
- `client/src/game-controller.ts` (add touch event handlers)
- `client/index.html` (add mobile control UI)
- `client/css/game.css` (mobile-responsive styling)

### Bug #10: NPM Package Vulnerabilities
**Priority:** 🟡 High  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Location:** `package.json` (client dependencies)  
**Discovered:** npm audit

**Description:**  
NPM audit reports 6 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 4 high) in the dependency tree.

**Vulnerability Details:**
```
braces <3.0.3
Severity: high
Uncontrolled resource consumption in braces
https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-grv7-fg5c-xmjg

Dependency chain:
- braces (vulnerable)
  └─ chokidar 1.3.0 - 2.1.8
     └─ live-server >=1.2.1
  └─ micromatch <=4.0.7
     └─ anymatch 1.2.0 - 2.0.0
        └─ readdirp 2.2.0 - 2.2.1
```

**Expected Behavior:**  
- No security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Up-to-date packages with security patches

**Actual Behavior:**  
- 6 vulnerabilities present (2 moderate, 4 high)
- Outdated versions of braces, chokidar, micromatch, anymatch, readdirp

**Root Cause:**  
Outdated `live-server` dev dependency using vulnerable versions of its dependencies.

**Fix Plan:**
1. Run `npm audit fix --force` to update to live-server@1.2.0
   - Note: This is a breaking change, requires testing
2. Alternative: Replace live-server with a different dev server (e.g., http-server, serve)
3. Test that dev server still works after update
4. Verify no functionality broken by the update
5. Re-run `npm audit` to confirm vulnerabilities resolved

**Important Notes:**
- These are **dev dependencies only** (live-server)
- Does NOT affect production build or deployed code
- Security risk is limited to development environment
- Still worth fixing for developer security and clean audits

**Affected Components:**
- `client/package.json` (live-server dependency)
- Development workflow (local server)

## 🟢 Low Priority Issues

### Bug #5: Extend Button Misleading Label
**Priority:** 🟢 Low  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Location:** `client/index.html`, `client/src/host-manager.ts`  
**Discovered:** E2E Testing Phase 4

**Description:**  
The "Extend Deadline" button displays "(+6h)" suggesting it will extend by exactly 6 hours, but it actually prompts the user for a custom number of hours.

**Expected Behavior (Two Options):**
- **Option A:** Button extends by exactly 6 hours (no prompt)
- **Option B:** Button label should be "Extend Deadline..." (indicating prompt)

**Actual Behavior:**  
- Button says "Extend Deadline (+6h)"
- Clicking shows prompt for custom hours
- User can enter any value

**Root Cause:**  
Label doesn't match functionality

**Fix Plan:**  
Choose one approach:
- **Option A:** Remove prompt, extend by 6h exactly, add another button for custom
- **Option B:** Change label to "Extend Deadline..." or "Extend Deadline (Custom)"

**Recommendation:** Option B - More flexible for different game pacing needs

**Affected Components:**
- `client/index.html` (button text)
- `client/src/host-manager.ts` (extendRound method)

### Bug #8: Flash Before Splash Screen
**Priority:** 🟢 Low  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Location:** `client/index.html` or page initialization  
**Discovered:** User Testing

**Description:**  
On initial page load, there is a brief flash (~1 second) where the underlying game page is visible before the "Start New Game" splash screen loads and covers it.

**Expected Behavior:**  
- Splash screen should be immediately visible on page load
- No underlying content should be visible before splash screen appears
- Smooth, professional loading experience

**Actual Behavior:**  
- Brief flash of game board/UI visible
- Splash screen loads after ~1 second delay
- Creates unprofessional first impression

**Root Cause:** TBD  
**Likely Issues:**
- Splash screen element not in initial HTML
- Splash screen created via JavaScript after page load
- CSS not properly hiding game UI on initial load
- Race condition between page render and splash display

**Fix Plan:**
1. Option A: Add splash screen to initial HTML with CSS to show by default
2. Option B: Add CSS to hide game UI until splash is dismissed
3. Option C: Use CSS loading animation/skeleton screen
4. Test various network speeds to ensure consistent behavior

**Affected Components:**
- `client/index.html` (splash screen HTML)
- `client/css/shared.css` or `client/css/game.css` (initial load styles)
- `client/src/player-app.ts` or `client/src/game-controller.ts` (initialization)

### Bug #11: Punycode Deprecation Warning
**Priority:** 🟢 Low  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Location:** Node.js runtime dependencies  
**Discovered:** Runtime console output

**Description:**  
Node.js deprecation warning appears during runtime:
```
(node:37164) [DEP0040] DeprecationWarning: The `punycode` module is deprecated. 
Please use a userland alternative instead.
```

**Expected Behavior:**  
- No deprecation warnings in console
- Dependencies use modern, non-deprecated APIs

**Actual Behavior:**  
- Warning appears during runtime
- Creates console noise
- No functional impact

**Root Cause:**  
One or more dependencies are using the deprecated built-in `punycode` module instead of the userland `punycode` package.

**Fix Plan:**
1. Identify which dependency is using deprecated punycode module
   - Run with `--trace-warnings` flag to find source
2. Check if newer version of that dependency is available
3. Update dependency to version that uses userland punycode
4. If no update available, consider alternative package
5. Verify warning no longer appears

**Affected Components:**
- `package.json` or `api/package.json` (whichever has the problematic dependency)
- Various npm dependencies (TBD which specific package)

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### Bug #2: Wall Generation Issues
**Priority:** 🔴 Critical  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Location:** `shared/game-engine.ts`, `shared/l-shape-utils.ts`  
**Discovered:** E2E Testing Phase 4  
**Fixed:** 2025-10-08

**Description:**  
Multiple problems with the puzzle wall generation algorithm:

**Sub-Issue 2a: Missing Outer Edge Walls** ✅ FIXED
- Walls perpendicular to outer edges were not being generated
- Design spec requires 8 outer edge walls (2 per quadrant)

**Sub-Issue 2b: U Shapes Instead of L Shapes** ✅ NOT A BUG
- Visual misinterpretation during testing
- L-shapes were correct, just in various orientations

**Sub-Issue 2c: L Shapes Touching Each Other** ✅ FIXED
- Wall generation created duplicate L-shapes that could overlap
- Design spec: L-shapes should never touch

**Sub-Issue 2d: L Shapes Without Associated Goals** ✅ FIXED
- Original `generateWalls()` created 17 orphaned L-shapes
- Then goal placement added 17 MORE L-shapes (34 total!)
- Design spec: Each L-shape should have exactly one goal in its corner

**Sub-Issue 2e: Missing Center Square** ✅ FIXED
- No 2×2 wall square in the middle blocking center 4 tiles
- Design spec requires this center obstruction

**Root Cause:**  
The fundamental problem was that **wall generation and goal placement were decoupled**. The old implementation:
1. Generated 17 random L-shapes (no goals) in `l-shape-utils.ts`
2. Then generated 17 goals with their own L-shapes in `goal-placement.ts`
3. Result: 34 L-shapes total, 17 without goals, potential overlaps
4. Missing center square and outer edge walls entirely

**Fix Implementation:**
1. **Added wall initialization functions** in `l-shape-utils.ts`:
   - `initializeWalls()`: Creates empty wall structure
   - `addCenterSquare()`: Adds 2×2 center blocking walls (8 walls)
   - `addOuterEdgeWalls()`: Adds 8 outer edge walls (2 per quadrant)
   
2. **Refactored puzzle generation** in `game-engine.ts`:
   - Initialize walls → Add center square → Add outer edges → Generate goals
   - Goals are now the PRIMARY and ONLY source of L-shapes
   - Deprecated old `generateWalls()` function
   
3. **Fixed robot placement**:
   - Robots no longer spawn in blocked center square
   - Robots never spawn on goal positions
   
4. **Updated Jest configuration**:
   - Added `moduleNameMapper` to handle `.js` extensions in TypeScript imports

**Verification:**
- All 210 unit/integration tests passing
- Wall count: 8 (center) + 8 (edges) + 34 (17 L-shapes × 2) = 50 walls per puzzle
- Each puzzle has exactly 17 goals (16 single-color + 1 multi-color)
- Each goal sits in corner of exactly one L-shape
- L-shapes cannot overlap (enforced by existing overlap detection)

**Files Modified:**
- `shared/l-shape-utils.ts` - Added initialization functions
- `shared/game-engine.ts` - Refactored `generatePuzzle()`
- `package.json` - Fixed Jest module resolution
- `tests/manual/verify-wall-generation.ts` - Verification script

**Additional Fixes (2025-10-08 Evening):**
After visual inspection of generated puzzles, three critical issues were identified and fixed:

1. **Outer Edge Wall Orientation** - Walls were parallel to edges instead of perpendicular
   - Fixed: Changed from horizontal walls on row 0/15 to vertical walls AT those rows
   - Result: Walls now stick out perpendicular into the board as intended

2. **Center Square Structure** - Walls were blocking movement OUT instead of IN
   - Root cause: Walls placed at rows 7-8 instead of surrounding rows 6 and 9
   - Fixed: Repositioned walls to surround the center square perimeter
   - Result: Center 2×2 area now properly blocked from entry

3. **Goals in Center Square** - Goals could spawn in blocked center area
   - Root cause: Quadrant boundaries included positions 7-8 (overlapping with center)
   - Fixed: Changed quadrants from 1-7/8-14 to 1-6/9-14 (excluding center rows/cols)
   - Added retry logic to handle smaller quadrant space constraints

**Test Results:**
```
Test Suites: 8 passed, 8 total
Tests:       2 skipped, 208 passed, 210 total
```

**Verification:**
- Center square: 8 walls surrounding (7,7), (7,8), (8,7), (8,8) ✅
- Outer edges: 8 perpendicular walls (2 per quadrant) ✅
- Goals: Never in center square, properly distributed across quadrants ✅
- Robots: Never in center or on goals ✅
- L-shapes: 17 total (one per goal), no overlaps ✅

**Final Refinements (2025-10-08 Late Evening):**
After further E2E testing, additional wall placement issues were discovered and fixed:

1. **Goals in Fully Enclosed Tiles** - Goals could be placed in unreachable tiles
   - Issue: L-shape creates 2 walls, but if other 2 walls existed, goal was trapped
   - Fixed: Added `wouldBeFullyEnclosed()` check to `canPlaceLShape()`
   - Checks if placement would complete a 4-walled box around the goal
   
2. **L-Shapes Forming Continuous Paths** - L-shapes could connect end-to-end
   - Issue: Walls aligned consecutively creating long connected barriers
   - Fixed: Attempted adjacency detection but was too complex
   - Final solution: **3×3 exclusion zone** - goals can't be within 3×3 box of each other
   - Simple distance check: `dx <= 1 && dy <= 1` → reject
   
3. **L-Shapes Touching Static Walls** - L-shapes could touch edge walls/center
   - Issue: Distance check didn't account for static walls
   - Fixed: **Hybrid approach** combining distance + adjacency checks
   - Distance check for goal-to-goal separation
   - Adjacency check for goal-to-static-wall separation

**Final canPlaceLShape() Logic:**
```typescript
1. Direct overlap check (walls don't overlap existing L-shapes)
2. 3×3 exclusion zone (goals stay separated from each other)
3. Static wall adjacency (L-shapes don't touch edge walls/center)
4. Enclosure check (goals aren't trapped in 4-walled tiles)
```

**Benefits of Hybrid Approach:**
- Simple distance-based separation between L-shapes
- Precise adjacency detection for static walls
- Comprehensive coverage with no complex edge cases
- All 210 tests passing ✅

### Bug #4: Robot Movement Animation Desync
**Priority:** 🟡 High  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Location:** `client/src/game-controller.ts`  
**Discovered:** E2E Testing Phase 4  
**Fixed:** 2025-10-09

**Description:**  
When pressing two direction keys quickly in succession:
- First move animation is skipped/not rendered
- Second move animation plays
- Underlying robot state is correct (both moves processed)
- Visual representation desyncs from actual position

**Expected Behavior:**  
- Both moves should be visually animated in sequence
- Visual state should always match logical state

**Actual Behavior:**  
- First move is processed but not animated
- Second move is animated
- Creates visual confusion

**Root Cause:**  
The `move()` method was async and awaited animations, but the keyboard event handler did NOT await the move() call. This allowed concurrent move() calls to run simultaneously, causing animation conflicts where the second animation would overwrite the first.

**Fix Implementation (Option A):**
Implemented animation queueing for smooth, sequential gameplay:

1. **Added queue infrastructure:**
   ```typescript
   private animationQueue: Array<{robot: string, direction: string}> = [];
   private isProcessingQueue: boolean = false;
   private readonly MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 50;
   ```

2. **Refactored move() method:**
   - Adds moves to queue instead of processing immediately
   - Prevents queue from exceeding 50 moves (overflow protection)
   - Sets `isProcessingQueue` flag BEFORE awaiting to prevent race conditions
   - Disables buttons immediately when queue starts

3. **Created processQueue() method:**
   - Processes queued moves sequentially with animations
   - Each move fully animates before next begins
   - Updates state and UI after each move
   - Re-enables buttons when queue is empty

4. **Created updateButtonStates() method:**
   - Centralized button state management
   - Disables undo/reset/submit during queue processing
   - Prevents state corruption from mid-animation actions

**Safety Features:**
- ✅ Race condition protection (flag set before await)
- ✅ Queue size limit (max 50 moves = ~15 seconds)
- ✅ Button blocking (undo/reset/submit disabled during animation)
- ✅ No queue clearing (buttons can't be clicked during processing)

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/game-controller.ts` - Added queue system and button state management

**Verification:**
- All 210 tests passing ✅
- Rapid key presses queue and animate sequentially
- Single moves animate smoothly
- All action buttons properly disabled during queue processing
- State and UI remain synchronized

**Benefits:**
- Smooth, polished visual experience
- All moves are visually represented
- No input is lost
- Safe state management with no edge cases
- Professional feel appropriate for puzzle game

**Implementation Options Considered:**
- **Option A:** Queue animations (smooth but slower) - ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Option B:** Skip animation if new input detected (fast but less smooth) - Not chosen
- **Option C:** Block input during animation (simple but slower) - Not chosen

### Bug #7: Outer Wall Generation Distance Issue
**Priority:** 🔴 Critical  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Location:** `shared/l-shape-utils.ts` (addOuterEdgeWalls function)  
**Discovered:** User Testing  
**Fixed:** 2025-10-12

**Description:**  
Outer edge walls were being generated up to 8 tiles from corners, but according to the design specification, they should only be placed 2-7 tiles from each corner.

**Expected Behavior:**  
- Each quadrant gets 2 outer edge walls (8 total)
- Walls should be perpendicular to outer edges
- Wall distance from corner: minimum 2 tiles, maximum 7 tiles

**Actual Behavior:**  
- Walls could be placed 8 tiles from corners
- This violated the design specification range of 2-7

**Root Cause:**  
The random range calculations in `addOuterEdgeWalls()` used incorrect ranges. The function was generating:
- NW quadrant: columns/rows 2-7 (using `Math.random() * 6 + 2`)
- NE/SE/SW quadrants: columns/rows 8-13 (using `Math.random() * 6 + 8`)

**Understanding Wall Indexing:**
On a 16×16 board (tile indices 0-15), a vertical wall at column index C sits to the RIGHT of tile column C:
- Tiles to the left: tiles 0 through C = C+1 tiles
- Tiles to the right: tiles C+1 through 15 = 15-C tiles

**The Problem:**
- Wall at column 7: (7+1)=8 tiles from left corner ❌, (15-7)=8 tiles from right corner ❌
- Wall at column 8: (8+1)=9 tiles from left corner, (15-8)=7 tiles from right corner ✓

The old ranges allowed walls at positions 7 and 8, which are 8 tiles from at least one corner.

**Fix Implementation:**
Changed random calculations to correct ranges:
- **Left half:** `Math.random() * 6 + 1` → generates 1-6 (was 2-7)
  - Wall at column 1: 2 tiles from left ✓, 14 tiles from right ✓
  - Wall at column 6: 7 tiles from left ✓, 9 tiles from right ✓
  
- **Right half:** `Math.random() * 6 + 8` → generates 8-13 (unchanged)
  - Wall at column 8: 9 tiles from left ✓, 7 tiles from right ✓
  - Wall at column 13: 14 tiles from left ✓, 2 tiles from right ✓

This ensures all walls are exactly 2-7 tiles from their nearest corner.

**Verification:**
- Created diagnostic script `tests/manual/check-outer-walls.ts`
- Verified 10 sample puzzles show wall distances of 2-7 tiles from nearest corner
- All 210 unit and integration tests pass ✓

**Files Modified:**
- `shared/l-shape-utils.ts` - Updated `addOuterEdgeWalls()` to use ranges 1-6 and 8-13
- `tests/manual/check-outer-walls.ts` - Created diagnostic verification script

**Affected Components:**
- `shared/l-shape-utils.ts` (addOuterEdgeWalls function)

### Bug #1: Extend Round Returns 404
**Priority:** 🔴 Critical  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Location:** API endpoint `/host/extendRound`  
**Discovered:** E2E Testing Phase 4  
**Fixed:** 2025-10-12

**Description:**  
When clicking the "Extend Deadline" button and submitting a custom hour value, the API returned a 404 error instead of extending the round deadline.

**Root Cause:**  
HTTP method mismatch between client and server:
- **Server (hostExtendRound.ts):** Configured to accept `POST` requests
- **Client (api-client.ts):** Sending `PUT` requests

The Azure Functions routing couldn't match the endpoint because the HTTP method was incorrect, resulting in a 404 Not Found error.

**Fix Implementation:**  
Changed the API client to use the correct HTTP method:

**File:** `client/src/api-client.ts` (extendRound method)
```typescript
// BEFORE:
method: 'PUT',

// AFTER:
method: 'POST',
```

**Rationale for POST:**
- Maintains consistency with other host endpoints (startRound, endRound all use POST)
- These are command-style operations rather than pure REST resource updates
- POST is appropriate for operations with complex business logic and side effects

**Files Modified:**
1. `client/src/api-client.ts` - Changed HTTP method from PUT to POST
2. `doc/api-specification.md` - Updated documentation to reflect POST method

**Verification:**
- ✅ Client now sends POST requests to `/api/host/extendRound`
- ✅ Server accepts POST requests on the same route
- ✅ HTTP method mismatch resolved
- ✅ Ready for E2E testing

**Affected Components:**
- `client/src/api-client.ts` (extendRound method)
- `api/src/functions/hostExtendRound.ts` (already correct)
- `client/src/host-manager.ts` (no changes needed - uses api-client)
