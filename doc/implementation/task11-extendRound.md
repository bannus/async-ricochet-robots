# Task 11: extendRound Endpoint - Implementation Summary

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Duration:** ~20 minutes  
**File:** `api/host/extendRound/index.ts`

## Overview

Implemented a simple but useful endpoint that allows hosts to extend round deadlines. This is helpful when players need more time or when the host wants to give the community extra opportunity to participate.

## Implementation Details

### Endpoint Specification

**Method:** POST  
**Path:** `/api/host/extendRound`  
**Authentication:** Host key required  
**Body Parameters:**
- `gameId` (required) - Game identifier
- `roundId` (required) - Round identifier
- `hostKey` (required) - Host authentication token
- `additionalTimeMs` (required) - Milliseconds to add to deadline

### Key Features

#### Simple Time Extension ✅

**Adds time to current deadline:**
```typescript
const newEndTime = round.endTime + additionalTimeMs;
await Storage.rounds.updateRound(gameId, roundId, {
  endTime: newEndTime
});
```

**Why additive:**
- Simple calculation
- No confusion about absolute times
- Clear semantics ("add 2 hours")
- Works for already-expired rounds

#### Active Round Validation ✅

**Only extends active rounds:**
```typescript
if (round.status !== 'active') {
  return errorResponse(
    `Cannot extend a ${round.status} round...`,
    'ROUND_NOT_ACTIVE',
    400
  );
}
```

**Why this restriction:**
- Completed rounds shouldn't be reopened
- Skipped rounds are intentionally ended
- Prevents confusion
- Clear error message

#### Helpful Response Data ✅

**Returns timing information:**
- Previous and new deadlines (ISO format)
- Hours added (human-readable)
- Time remaining
- Next steps for host

### Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "Round deadline extended by 2 hours.",
    "round": {
      "roundId": "game_abc_round1",
      "roundNumber": 1,
      "gameId": "game_abc",
      "goal": { "color": "red", "position": { "x": 3, "y": 5 } },
      "originalEndTime": 1704000000000,
      "newEndTime": 1704007200000,
      "timeAdded": 7200000,
      "timeRemaining": 7195000,
      "status": "active"
    },
    "timing": {
      "previousDeadline": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "newDeadline": "2024-01-01T02:00:00.000Z",
      "extensionHours": 2,
      "remainingMs": 7195000,
      "remainingHours": 2.0
    },
    "nextSteps": [
      "Players now have more time to submit solutions",
      "The leaderboard will remain open until the new deadline",
      "End the round manually or wait for the timer"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Error Scenarios

| Scenario | Status | Code | Message |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| Missing params | 400 | VALIDATION_ERROR | Field is required |
| Invalid hostKey | 401 | UNAUTHORIZED | Invalid host key |
| Invalid time | 400 | VALIDATION_ERROR | Invalid duration |
| Round not active | 400 | ROUND_NOT_ACTIVE | Cannot extend completed/skipped round |
| Round not found | 404 | ROUND_NOT_FOUND | Round not found |

### Use Cases

**Common scenarios:**
1. **Need more time** - Not enough submissions yet
2. **Technical issues** - Players had connectivity problems
3. **Community request** - Players ask for extension
4. **Timezone fairness** - Give global players a chance
5. **Difficult puzzle** - Goal is harder than expected

### Example Usage

**Extend by 2 hours:**
```json
{
  "gameId": "game_abc123",
  "roundId": "game_abc123_round1",
  "hostKey": "host_xyz789",
  "additionalTimeMs": 7200000
}
```

**Extend by 1 day:**
```json
{
  "gameId": "game_abc123",
  "roundId": "game_abc123_round1",
  "hostKey": "host_xyz789",
  "additionalTimeMs": 86400000
}
```

**Common durations:**
- 1 hour: 3,600,000 ms
- 2 hours: 7,200,000 ms
- 6 hours: 21,600,000 ms
- 12 hours: 43,200,000 ms
- 24 hours: 86,400,000 ms

### Design Decisions

**1. Additive Extension**
- Simpler than setting absolute time
- Clear intent ("add 2 hours")
- Works even if deadline passed
- Easy to use

**2. Active Round Only**
- Prevents reopening completed rounds
- Clear business logic
- Avoids confusion
- Protects game integrity

**3. ISO Timestamps**
- Human-readable
- Timezone-aware
- Standard format
- Easy to display

**4. Hours Display**
- Rounds to 1 decimal place
- More readable than milliseconds
- Common unit for time extensions
- Still includes exact ms in response

### Integration

**Storage Layer:**
- `Storage.games.getGame()` - Authentication
- `Storage.rounds.getRound()` - Get round
- `Storage.rounds.updateRound()` - Update deadline

**Validation Layer:**
- `validateExtendRoundRequest()` - Input validation
- Standard response/error handling
