# Task 7: submitSolution Endpoint - Implementation Summary

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Duration:** ~1 hour  
**File:** `api/submitSolution/index.ts`

## Overview

Implemented the most complex player-facing endpoint that validates solutions using the game engine, prevents duplicate submissions, and provides immediate feedback with rank calculation and achievements.

## Implementation Details

### Endpoint Specification

**Method:** POST  
**Path:** `/api/submitSolution`  
**Authentication:** Anonymous (public player access)  
**Body Parameters:**
- `gameId` (required) - Game identifier
- `roundId` (required) - Round identifier
- `playerName` (required) - Player's name (1-20 chars)
- `solutionData` (required) - Array of moves

### Key Features

#### 1. Game Engine Integration ‚úÖ

**Validation Flow:**
```typescript
const validationResult = validateSolution(
  round.robotPositions,  // Initial state
  game.board.walls,      // Wall configuration
  solutionData,          // Player's moves
  round.goal             // Target goal
);
```

**What the engine validates:**
- All moves are valid Move objects
- Robots move according to ricochet rules
- Final position matches goal
- Correct robot reaches goal (or any robot for multi-color goals)

#### 2. Multi-Layer Validation ‚úÖ

**Five validation checkpoints:**

1. **Input Validation** (validateSubmitSolutionRequest)
   - Required fields present
   - Correct data types
   - Format validation (gameId, roundId, playerName patterns)
   - Solution data is valid array

2. **Round Status Check**
   - Round must be 'active'
   - Rejects if 'completed' or 'skipped'

3. **Deadline Check**
   - Current time < round.endTime
   - Prevents late submissions

4. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - Query existing solutions by playerName
   - One submission per player per round
   - Returns 409 CONFLICT if duplicate

5. **Game Engine Validation**
   - Solution actually solves the puzzle
   - Uses proven game engine from Phase 2
   - Detailed error messages from validation

#### 3. Rank Calculation ‚úÖ

**Immediate rank feedback:**
```typescript
// Get all solutions
const allSolutions = await Storage.solutions.getLeaderboard(gameId, roundId);

// Sort: moveCount (asc), then submittedAt (asc)
allSolutions.sort((a, b) => {
  if (a.moveCount !== b.moveCount) {
    return a.moveCount - b.moveCount;
  }
  return a.submittedAt - b.submittedAt;
});

// Find player's rank with tie handling
let rank = 1;
for (let i = 0; i < allSolutions.length; i++) {
  if (i > 0 && allSolutions[i].moveCount > allSolutions[i - 1].moveCount) {
    rank = i + 1;
  }
  if (allSolutions[i].playerName === playerName.toLowerCase().trim()) {
    break;
  }
}
```

#### 4. Achievement System ‚úÖ

**Conditional achievements:**
- Rank 1: "Current leader! üèÜ"
- Rank 2-3: "Top {rank}! üéØ"
- Other ranks: No achievement (but still shown)

### Response Format

**Success Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    message: "Solution submitted successfully!",
    solution: {
      playerName: "alice",
      moveCount: 12,
      winningRobot: "red",
      submittedAt: 1704000000000,
      rank: 1,
      totalSolutions: 5
    },
    leaderboard: {
      yourRank: 1,
      totalPlayers: 5,
      topScore: 12,
      yourScore: 12,
      achievement: "Current leader! üèÜ"  // Conditional
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Scenarios

| Scenario | Status | Code | Message |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| Missing fields | 400 | VALIDATION_ERROR | Field is required |
| Invalid format | 400 | VALIDATION_ERROR | Invalid format |
| Round ended | 400 | ROUND_ENDED | Round has ended |
| Deadline passed | 400 | DEADLINE_PASSED | Deadline has passed |
| Duplicate | 409 | DUPLICATE_SUBMISSION | Already submitted |
| Invalid solution | 400 | INVALID_SOLUTION | Solution doesn't reach goal |
| Game not found | 404 | GAME_NOT_FOUND | Game not found |
| Round not found | 404 | ROUND_NOT_FOUND | Round not found |

### Implementation Flow

```
1. Parse & Validate Request Body
   ‚Üì
2. Fetch Game & Round Data
   ‚Üì
3. Check Round Status (must be 'active')
   ‚Üì
4. Check Deadline (now < endTime)
   ‚Üì
5. Check for Duplicate Submission
   ‚Üì
6. Validate Solution with Game Engine
   ‚Üì
7. Store Solution in Database
   ‚Üì
8. Calculate Rank Among All Solutions
   ‚Üì
9. Return Success with Rank & Achievement
```

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. **Validation Order**

Ordered from cheapest to most expensive:
1. Input validation (in-memory)
2. Round status check (single DB query)
3. Duplicate check (single DB query)
4. Game engine validation (CPU-intensive)

This minimizes wasted computation on invalid requests.

#### 2. **Move Count Calculation**

```typescript
moveCount: solutionData.length  // Simple array length
```

The game engine validates the solution works, so we just count the moves. No need to recalculate from validation result.

#### 3. **Rank Calculation Timing**

Calculated **after** storing the solution so:
- Player's own solution is included in ranking
- Accurate rank reflects current state
- No race conditions

#### 4. **Error Messages**

Different error codes for different scenarios:
- `ROUND_ENDED` vs `DEADLINE_PASSED` - helps debugging
- `INVALID_SOLUTION` includes specific reason from engine
- Clear, actionable messages for players

### Integration Points

**Game Engine (Phase 2):**
- `validateSolution()` - Core validation logic
- Uses proven, tested algorithm (207/207 tests passing)
- Returns detailed ValidationResult

**Storage Layer:**
- `Storage.games.getGame()` - Get board/walls
- `Storage.rounds.getRound()` - Get goal/robots
- `Storage.solutions.getSolution()` - Duplicate check
- `Storage.solutions.submitSolution()` - Store solution
- `Storage.solutions.getLeaderboard()` - Rank calculation

**Validation Layer:**
- `validateSubmitSolutionRequest()` - Input validation
- `successResponse()` - Standard response format
- `errorResponse()` - Error response format
- `handleError()` - Error handling

### Edge Cases Handled

1. **Deadline edge case:**
   - Checks `Date.now() > round.endTime`
   - Prevents submissions right at deadline
   - Clear error message

2. **Duplicate submission:**
   - Uses normalized playerName (lowercase, trimmed)
   - Returns 409 CONFLICT (standard HTTP for duplicates)
   - Preserves first submission

3. **Multi-color goals:**
   - Game engine handles "multi" goal color
   - Accepts any robot reaching goal
   - Returns which robot won

4. **Rank tie-breaking:**
   - Same moveCount = same rank
   - Earlier submission listed first
   - Next rank skips appropriately

5. **Missing validation result:**
   - Checks `validationResult.winningRobot!`
   - Safe because we checked `valid === true` first
   - TypeScript non-null assertion justified

### Testing Scenarios

**Valid Submissions:**
1. First solution for a round
2. Solution with multi-color goal
3. Minimum move solution (1 move)
4. Maximum length solution (within limits)
5. Solution that ties with existing

**Invalid Submissions:**
1. Missing required fields
2. Invalid move format
3. Solution doesn't reach goal
4. Moves robot off board
5. Duplicate submission
6. Round has ended
7. Deadline passed
8. Game doesn't exist
9. Round doesn't exist

**Rank Calculation:**
1. First submission (rank 1)
2. Better than existing (new rank 1)
3. Worse than existing (rank > 1)
4. Tied with existing (shared rank)
5. Multiple ties

### Performance Considerations

**Database Queries:**
- 2 queries for validation (game, round)
- 1 query for duplicate check
- 1 write for solution
- 1 query for leaderboard (rank calculation)
- **Total: 5 operations**

**Optimizations:**
- Early returns prevent unnecessary work
- Single leaderboard query for ranking
- In-memory sorting (fast for typical sizes)

**Scalability:**
- Leaderboard query limited by partition key (gameId_roundId)
- Typical round: <100 solutions
- Sorting 100 items is negligible
- Could cache leaderboard if needed (future optimization)
