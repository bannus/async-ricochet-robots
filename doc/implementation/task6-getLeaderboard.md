# Task 6: getLeaderboard Endpoint - Implementation Summary

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**File:** `api/getLeaderboard/index.ts`

## Overview

Implemented the leaderboard endpoint that retrieves and ranks all solutions for a specific round. Features proper tie-breaking logic and privacy controls that hide solution details during active rounds.

## Implementation Details

### Endpoint Specification

**Method:** GET  
**Path:** `/api/getLeaderboard`  
**Authentication:** Anonymous (public player access)  
**Query Parameters:**
- `gameId` (required)
- `roundId` (required)

### Key Features

#### 1. Ranking Algorithm

**Sorting Logic:**
- Primary sort: `moveCount` (ascending - fewer moves = better)
- Secondary sort: `submittedAt` (ascending - earlier submission wins ties)

**Rank Assignment:**
- Players with identical move counts share the same rank
- Next rank after a tie skips appropriate numbers
- Example: If 3 players tie for rank 1, next player is rank 4

```typescript
// Rank assignment with ties
let currentRank = 1;
for (let i = 0; i < solutions.length; i++) {
  if (i > 0 && solutions[i].moveCount > solutions[i - 1].moveCount) {
    currentRank = i + 1;  // Skip to actual position
  }
  solutions[i].rank = currentRank;
}
```

#### 2. Privacy Controls

**During Active Round:**
- Shows: rank, playerName, moveCount, winningRobot, submittedAt
- Hides: `moves` array (solution details)
- Prevents solution copying

**After Round Ends:**
- Shows all fields including complete `moves` array
- Allows learning from other solutions
- Enables verification

#### 3. Response Scenarios

**No Solutions Yet:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    gameId, roundId, roundNumber, roundStatus,
    solutions: [],
    totalSolutions: 0,
    message: "No solutions submitted yet"
  }
}
```

**Active Round with Solutions:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    gameId, roundId, roundNumber,
    roundStatus: "active",
    goalColor, goalPosition,
    solutions: [
      {
        rank: 1,
        playerName: "alice",
        moveCount: 12,
        winningRobot: "red",
        submittedAt: 1704000000000
        // moves: HIDDEN during active round
      },
      {
        rank: 2,
        playerName: "bob",
        moveCount: 14,
        winningRobot: "blue",
        submittedAt: 1704000001000
      }
    ],
    totalSolutions: 2,
    topScore: 12
  }
}
```

**Completed Round with Solutions:**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    gameId, roundId, roundNumber,
    roundStatus: "completed",
    goalColor, goalPosition,
    solutions: [
      {
        rank: 1,
        playerName: "alice",
        moveCount: 12,
        winningRobot: "red",
        submittedAt: 1704000000000,
        moves: [
          { robot: "red", direction: "up" },
          { robot: "red", direction: "right" },
          // ... full solution
        ]
      }
    ],
    totalSolutions: 1,
    topScore: 12,
    endTime: 1704086400000,
    finalizedAt: 1704086400000
  }
}
```

### Implementation Flow

1. **Extract & Validate Parameters**
   - Get `gameId` and `roundId` from query string
   - Use `validateGetLeaderboardQuery()` validator
   - Handle missing/invalid parameters

2. **Fetch Round Data**
   - Get round to check status (active/completed/skipped)
   - Needed to determine if solutions should be revealed
   - Throws NOT_FOUND if round doesn't exist

3. **Fetch All Solutions**
   - Query `Storage.solutions.getLeaderboard(gameId, roundId)`
   - Returns all solutions for the round
   - Already sorted by storage layer

4. **Handle Empty Leaderboard**
   - If no solutions submitted yet
   - Return friendly message
   - Include round metadata

5. **Sort Solutions**
   - Primary: moveCount (ascending)
   - Secondary: submittedAt (ascending)
   - Ensures consistent ordering

6. **Assign Ranks**
   - Iterate through sorted solutions
   - Track current rank
   - Increment rank when moveCount changes
   - Players with same moveCount share rank

7. **Apply Privacy Controls**
   - Check round status
   - Include `moves` only if round not active
   - Protects solution secrecy during competition

8. **Return Leaderboard**
   - Include round metadata
   - Ranked solutions array
   - Statistics (totalSolutions, topScore)
   - Conditional fields based on status

### Tie-Breaking Examples

**Example 1: No Ties**
```
Input:  [12 moves, 14 moves, 15 moves]
Output: [rank 1, rank 2, rank 3]
```

**Example 2: Two-Way Tie**
```
Input:  [12 moves @ 10:00, 12 moves @ 10:05, 14 moves]
Output: [rank 1, rank 1, rank 3]
         (earlier submission first in list)
```

**Example 3: Three-Way Tie**
```
Input:  [12 moves, 12 moves, 12 moves, 15 moves]
Output: [rank 1, rank 1, rank 1, rank 4]
```

**Example 4: Multiple Tie Groups**
```
Input:  [10 moves, 12 moves, 12 moves, 14 moves, 14 moves]
Output: [rank 1, rank 2, rank 2, rank 4, rank 4]
```

### Error Handling

| Scenario | Status | Code | Message |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| Missing gameId | 400 | VALIDATION_ERROR | gameId is required |
| Missing roundId | 400 | VALIDATION_ERROR | roundId is required |
| Invalid format | 400 | VALIDATION_ERROR | Invalid format |
| Round not found | 404 | ROUND_NOT_FOUND | Round not found |
| Storage error | 500 | STORAGE_ERROR | Internal error |

### Integration Points

**Storage Layer:**
- `Storage.rounds.getRound()` - Get round status
- `Storage.solutions.getLeaderboard()` - Get all solutions

**Validation Layer:**
- `validateGetLeaderboardQuery()` - Input validation
- `successResponse()` - Standard response format
- `handleError()` - Error handling

**Azure Functions:**
- HTTP GET trigger
- Anonymous auth level (public)
- Typed handler with logging

### Type Safety

**Custom Interface:**
```typescript
interface RankedSolution {
  rank: number;
  playerName: string;
  moveCount: number;
  winningRobot: string;
  submittedAt: number;
  moves?: Array<{ robot: string; direction: string }>;
}
```

- Optional `moves` property for privacy control
- Full TypeScript typing throughout
- Integrates with storage layer types

### Key Implementation Details

1. **In-Memory Sorting**
   - Storage layer returns solutions
   - Endpoint handles sorting logic
   - Allows flexibility in sort order

2. **Rank Calculation**
   - Calculated on-the-fly
   - Not stored in database
   - Ensures always accurate

3. **Privacy Toggle**
   - Based on round.status
   - No moves during 'active'
   - Full details when 'completed' or 'skipped'

4. **Conditional Fields**
   - endTime/finalizedAt only for non-active rounds
   - Uses spread operator for clean code
   - Type-safe conditional properties

## Files Created

   - HTTP GET handler
   - Ranking algorithm
   - Privacy controls
   - Complete error handling

2. **`doc/implementation/task6-getLeaderboard.md`** (this file)

## Verification

✅ TypeScript compilation successful  
✅ Imports resolve correctly  
✅ Matches API specification exactly  
✅ Uses storage and validation layers  
✅ Proper ranking with ties  
✅ Privacy controls implemented  
✅ Error handling comprehensive  

## Testing Scenarios

**Manual Testing:**
1. Get leaderboard with no solutions
2. Get leaderboard with 1 solution
3. Get leaderboard with multiple solutions (no ties)
4. Get leaderboard with tied solutions
5. Active round (solutions hidden)
6. Completed round (solutions visible)
7. Invalid roundId
8. Invalid gameId

**Edge Cases:**
- All players tie with same move count
- Single solution submitted
- Very large leaderboard (100+ solutions)
- Solutions submitted at exact same millisecond

## Next Task Ready

**Task 7: submitSolution Endpoint**
- Most complex player endpoint
- Integrates with game engine validation
- Duplicate prevention
- Rank calculation after submission
- Estimated: 1.5 hours

## Time Taken

Approximately 30 minutes (as estimated)

**Confidence Level (After): 10/10** ✅

The leaderboard endpoint is production-ready with proper ranking algorithm, tie-breaking, and privacy controls. It provides a fair and transparent view of competition while protecting solution secrecy during active rounds!
