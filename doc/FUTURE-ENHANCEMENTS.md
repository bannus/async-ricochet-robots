# Future Enhancements

This document tracks potential improvements and features that could be added to the Async Ricochet Robots project in future iterations.

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Loading Animations
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** Low (~2 hours)

**Description:**
Add visual loading spinners to improve user feedback during API operations.

**Locations to implement:**
1. **Leaderboard area** - While fetching leaderboard data
   - Replace static "Loading..." text with animated spinner
   - Shows data is being fetched

2. **Game board area** - During initial page load
   - Display spinner while waiting for `getCurrentRound` response
   - Prevents "frozen" appearance on slow connections

3. **Submit button** - During solution submission
   - Button shows inline spinner + "Submitting..." text
   - Prevents double-submissions
   - Provides confirmation that action is processing

4. **Host panel** - When starting/ending rounds
   - Visual feedback during round management operations
   - Confirms host actions are being processed

**Implementation approach:**
```css
.loading-spinner {
  border: 3px solid #f3f3f3;
  border-top: 3px solid var(--color-blue);
  border-radius: 50%;
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  animation: spin 1s linear infinite;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

@keyframes spin {
  0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}

/* Button with inline spinner */
.btn-loading {
  position: relative;
  color: transparent;
}

.btn-loading::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  width: 16px;
  height: 16px;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  margin-left: -8px;
  margin-top: -8px;
  border: 2px solid white;
  border-top-color: transparent;
  border-radius: 50%;
  animation: spin 0.6s linear infinite;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces user confusion during network delays
- Prevents duplicate submissions
- Professional appearance
- Meets modern UX expectations

**Dependencies:**
- None - pure CSS enhancement
- Can be added incrementally to different areas

## Performance Optimizations

### Canvas Rendering Optimization
**Priority:** Low  
**Effort:** Medium (~4 hours)

**Description:**
Optimize canvas rendering for better performance on lower-end devices.

**Potential improvements:**
1. Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
2. Implement dirty rectangle rendering (only redraw changed areas)
3. Cache rendered elements (robots, walls, goals) as separate canvas layers
4. Reduce re-renders during move preview

**Benefits:**
- Better performance on mobile devices
- Smoother animations
- Lower battery usage

## Feature Additions

### Move Animation Playback
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** High (~8 hours)

**Description:**
Animate robot movements when viewing solutions from the leaderboard.

**Features:**
1. Click on leaderboard entry to play back solution
2. Step-by-step animation showing each move
3. Playback controls (play, pause, step forward/back, speed)
4. Highlight current move in move list

**Benefits:**
- Educational - learn from other solutions
- Verification - confirm solutions work correctly
- Entertainment value

## Accessibility Improvements

### Screen Reader Support
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** Medium (~6 hours)

**Description:**
Enhance screen reader compatibility for visually impaired users.

**Enhancements:**
1. ARIA labels for all interactive elements
2. Announce game state changes
3. Keyboard-only solution input mode
4. Audio cues for move feedback
5. Semantic HTML improvements

**Standards compliance:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Section 508 compliance

## Testing & Quality

### Automated E2E Tests
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** High (~12 hours)

**Description:**
Implement automated end-to-end testing with Playwright or Cypress.

**Test coverage:**
1. Complete game flow (create → start round → solve → submit)
2. Host panel operations
3. Multi-player scenarios
4. Error handling
5. Responsive design

## Documentation

### Video Tutorial
**Priority:** Low  
**Effort:** Medium (~4 hours)

**Description:**
Create video walkthrough of gameplay and hosting.

**Content:**
1. How to create a game
2. How to solve puzzles
3. Host panel walkthrough
4. Tips and strategies
