# Future Enhancements

This document tracks potential improvements and features that could be added to the Async Ricochet Robots project in future iterations.

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Loading Animations
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** Low (~2 hours)

**Description:**
Add visual loading spinners to improve user feedback during API operations.

**Locations to implement:**
1. **Leaderboard area** - While fetching leaderboard data
   - Replace static "Loading..." text with animated spinner
   - Shows data is being fetched

2. **Game board area** - During initial page load
   - Display spinner while waiting for `getCurrentRound` response
   - Prevents "frozen" appearance on slow connections

3. **Submit button** - During solution submission
   - Button shows inline spinner + "Submitting..." text
   - Prevents double-submissions
   - Provides confirmation that action is processing

4. **Host panel** - When starting/ending rounds
   - Visual feedback during round management operations
   - Confirms host actions are being processed

**Implementation approach:**
```css
.loading-spinner {
  border: 3px solid #f3f3f3;
  border-top: 3px solid var(--color-blue);
  border-radius: 50%;
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  animation: spin 1s linear infinite;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

@keyframes spin {
  0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}

/* Button with inline spinner */
.btn-loading {
  position: relative;
  color: transparent;
}

.btn-loading::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  width: 16px;
  height: 16px;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  margin-left: -8px;
  margin-top: -8px;
  border: 2px solid white;
  border-top-color: transparent;
  border-radius: 50%;
  animation: spin 0.6s linear infinite;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces user confusion during network delays
- Prevents duplicate submissions
- Professional appearance
- Meets modern UX expectations

**Dependencies:**
- None - pure CSS enhancement
- Can be added incrementally to different areas

## Performance Optimizations

### Canvas Rendering Optimization
**Priority:** Low  
**Effort:** Medium (~4 hours)

**Description:**
Optimize canvas rendering for better performance on lower-end devices.

**Potential improvements:**
1. Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
2. Implement dirty rectangle rendering (only redraw changed areas)
3. Cache rendered elements (robots, walls, goals) as separate canvas layers
4. Reduce re-renders during move preview

**Benefits:**
- Better performance on mobile devices
- Smoother animations
- Lower battery usage

## Feature Additions

### Backend Solution Replay (Alternative Implementation)
**Priority:** Low  
**Effort:** Medium (~6 hours)

**Description:**
Alternative backend approach to solution replay that was considered but not implemented in favor of the simpler frontend approach.

**Proposed Features:**
1. Backend stores complete puzzle state for each round (walls, starting robot positions, goals)
2. New API endpoint: `GET /api/getRoundDetails?gameId=X&roundId=Y`
   - Returns full puzzle data for any completed round
   - Includes starting positions and goal information
3. Players can request any historical round data
4. Supports deep linking to specific rounds

**Why Not Implemented:**
- Current implementation (v1.2.0) solves the problem more simply
- Frontend already has all data needed from `getCurrentRound`
- No additional API calls required
- Less backend complexity

**When to Consider:**
- If we need historical round access beyond just the last completed round
- If we want to support "round archives" or "greatest hits"
- If players want to replay rounds from days/weeks ago

**Implementation Notes:**
- Would require additional storage access patterns
- Could increase API costs for historical data retrieval
- Frontend already caches completed round data during gameplay

### Advanced Replay Controls
**Priority:** Low  
**Effort:** Medium (~6 hours)

**Description:**
Enhanced replay functionality with more interactive controls.

**Proposed Features:**
1. **Playback speed control**
   - Slider: 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x speed
   - Keyboard shortcuts: `-` to slow down, `+` to speed up

2. **Step-by-step navigation**
   - Previous/Next move buttons
   - Keyboard shortcuts: `←` previous, `→` next
   - Move list with clickable steps

3. **Auto-replay**
   - Automatically play next solution when current finishes
   - Queue multiple solutions for continuous viewing

4. **Visual enhancements**
   - Trail showing robot path
   - Highlight which walls were used for stops
   - Move annotations (e.g., "Red bounces off wall")

5. **Comparison mode**
   - Side-by-side replay of two solutions
   - Synchronized playback
   - Highlight where strategies differ

**Benefits:**
- Better learning from other solutions
- Easier to understand complex strategies
- More engaging spectator experience
- Useful for teaching puzzle-solving techniques

**UI Mockup:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Replaying: Alice's solution     │
│ Move 3 of 7                      │
│                                  │
│ [◄◄] [||] [►] [►►]    Speed: 1x │
│                                  │
│ Moves:                           │
│ 1. Blue → Up                     │
│ 2. Red → Right                   │
│ 3. Blue → Right ◄ (current)      │
│ 4. Red → Down                    │
│ ...                              │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
